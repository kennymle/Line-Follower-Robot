# Line-Follower-Robot
Using energia IDE as the programming framework for the MSP432 microcontroller, a code was written to implement PD control that utilized IR sensors of the TI-RSLK robotic car such that the car would accurately follow a black line path. Upon sensing a horizontal line at the end of the path, the car would make a 180 degree turn to then follow the path backwards before stopping at the beginning.

Developed using the TI-RSLK kit (TI Launchpad).
